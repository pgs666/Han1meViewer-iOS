/// Shared state for the global tab-bar visibility, driven by pushed sub-pages
/// (e.g. video detail, settings) calling `acquireHidden(...)` / `release(...)`
/// on appear / disappear.
///
/// Why an external observable instead of `.toolbar(.hidden, for: .tabBar)`
/// directly on the sub-page:
///
/// SwiftUI's runtime does not reliably animate the tab-bar transition when a
/// `.toolbar(_:for:)` modifier is applied to the destination view inside a
/// NavigationStack push (verified bug-class on iOS 16–26 across versions).
/// The well-known working pattern (Stack Overflow / community-vetted) is:
///   • Hold `Visibility` as `@State` at a higher level.
///   • Apply `.toolbar(visibility, for: .tabBar)` to the NavigationStack
///     container, NOT the destination view.
///   • Toggle the @State inside `withAnimation { … }` from the destination's
///     `.onAppear` / `.onDisappear`.
/// SwiftUI then animates the tab-bar slide because the change is bound to
/// the NavigationStack's own layout pass.
///
/// Putting the state in an environment object lets every NavigationStack in
/// the four tabs subscribe to the same visibility, and lets every sub-page
/// (no matter how deep) toggle it without prop-drilling Bindings.
